    "## What is queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### we can define queue as an ordered list , linear abstract data structure which follows FIFO first in first out principal where we can add element ( enqueue operation) from the rare end of the queue and delete element (dequeue) from the front end of the queue \n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations: \n",
    "### Enqueue(): to insert the data in queue from the rare end \n",
    "### Dequeue(): to delete the data from queue from the front end\n",
    "### front(): it is similar to peek operation  in stack wherein it tends to display the data from front end \n",
    "### isFull(): it check whether the queue is full or not \n",
    "### isEmpty(): it check whether the queue is empty or not \n",
    "\n",
    "## overflow condition :\n",
    "### it arises when the queue is completely full and it still we are trying to add data to the queue \n",
    "\n",
    "## underflow condition: \n",
    "### it arises when queue is empty \n",
    "\n",
    "# Drawback of Queue \n",
    "### condition where rear==front and before that empty space is vacant and still if we try to add new data it is raising exception stating queue is full (memory wastage ) it can be over come using circular queue \n",
    "\n",
    "# Application of queue \n",
    "### 1. customer care call center \n",
    "### 2. in printing machine when it is shared with 4-5 PCs \n",
    "\n",
    "## when we try to implement queue using array \n",
    "### 1. chance of overflow is high \n",
    "### 2. time complexity is of O(n) for copy operation in case queue get full and all data has to copy to new biger array \n",
    "### 3. if we take to large array and cannot able to utilize the space fully then leads to wastage of memory \n",
    "\n",
    "## implementing using linked list \n",
    "### for enqueue time complexity O(1)\n",
    "### for dequeue time complexity O(n) \n",
    "### in order to over come time complexity of O(n) for dequeue operation we need to create one more pointer at the rear end of the queue \n",
